                                       8-bit with 5-stage pipeline microprocessor 

Introduction: 

Five stage (8 bit) pipelined processor with a unique data path and a control unit. 

The stages included Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Instruction Execute, Memory and Write Back. 

It has 17 instructions which can perform operations on operands in Registers/Immediate. 

Handles Jump operations based on the status/overflow flags. 

The Architecture has 16-bit address bus and can handle a total memory space of 64KB. Allocated 32KB for ROM & 32KB for RAM. 

The User program is stored in ROM and fetched by the processor.
